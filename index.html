                                Patek Philippe has been pursuing traditional Genevan<br>
                                watchmaking artistry without interruption since 1839.<br>
                                The manufacture benefits from full creative freedom,<br>
                                which allows it to design, develop, and craft watches<br>
                                that connoisseurs consider to be<br> 
                                the world's finest – as pledged by its founders<br>
                                Antoine Norbert de Patek and Adrien Philippe.<br>
                                In addition to exceptional skills, Patek Philippe also<br>
                                nurtures a tradition of innovation that has meanwhile<br>
                                been crowned by over one hundred patents.

                                Patek Philippe is an independent manufacture with vertically<br>

                            A good reason that may have convinced Jean Adrien Philippe to<br>
                            adopt the Calatrava cross in 1887(Antoine Norbert de Patek had<br>
                            passed away ten years earlier) was its graphically ornamental<br>
                            quality and the fact that it was a centuries-old signature.<br>
                            It is an aesthetically persuasive symbol whose beauty remains<br>
                            unaffected by passing fashion trends. Thus, it is an ideal<br>
                            hallmark for representing the values of Patek Philippe and<br>
                            the long-term horizon of its corporate philosophy.<br>

                            Today, the name Calatrava also has another meaning at<br>
                            Patek Philippe: it identifies an entire family of wristwatches<br>
                            that stand out with understated elegance and a timelessly<br>
                            beautiful design vocabulary. It has its roots in the Ref.<br>
                            96 launched in 1932. The design of the timepiece was inspired by<br>
                            the Bauhaus style based on the principle that form follows<br>
                            function – a signpost for modern wristwatches.

                                    Patek Philippe is the oldest independent, family-owned Genevan watch
                                    manufacture. Its independence enables it to control its own destiny while
                                    pursuing a long-term vision. The manufacture benefits from total creative
                                    freedom. It develops and crafts its watches and movements in-house according to
                                    its own quality criteria that are set forth in the Directives of the Patek
                                    Philippe Seal. This determination to remain independent is at the heart of Patek
                                    Philippe spirit; it guarantees continuity, resilience and trustworthiness.

                                    The history of the Patek Philippe manufacture, founded in 1839, is part of
                                    Geneva's great watchmaking tradition. It is the legacy born out of the
                                    experience and ingenuity of countless generations that safeguards and breathes
                                    life into the manufacture. It is a tradition of innovation that reinvents itself
                                    every day. True to noble artisanal techniques, master watchmakers and craftsmen
                                    consummately perpetuate, day after day, timeless gestures, lending their sharp
                                    eyes and deftness of touch to the fine art of watchmaking while remaining
                                    abreast of the latest technological developments.

                                    In keeping with its tradition of innovation, Patek Philippe constantly tests the
                                    frontiers of watchmaking artistry through its avant-garde achievements at the
                                    cutting edge of technology. The manufacture has asserted its pioneering role not
                                    least by successfully filing over 100 patents, including twenty of major
                                    importance to the history of horology. In the same context, the Patek Philippe
                                    Seal was established as a dynamic quality hallmark that accommodates
                                    technological progress in the service of long-term improvements of the
                                    functionality, reliability and rate accuracy of watches.

                                    Antoine Norbert de Patek and Adrien Philippe had but one goal: to develop and
                                    manufacture the finest timepieces in the world. Today, more than ever, quality
                                    and fine workmanship remain the watchwords for production at Patek Philippe.
                                    This applies to the movements and the external elements, the technical concept,
                                    the performance of each function, and the rate accuracy of the timepieces.
                                    Thierry and Philippe Stern personally stand by all the commitments embodied in
                                    the Patek Philippe Seal, the most exclusive of quality commitments in the entire
                                    industry.

                                    Patek Philippe has always conceived its watches as exclusive creations. Over 200
                                    different models are in regular production, crafted by the manufacture in small
                                    series of between a dozen and several hundred watches, each fitted with
                                    proprietary movements. The quality of the movements and watch cases is highly
                                    appreciated by watch enthusiasts. The rigorous quality standards applied to
                                    every step of the manufacturing process and the many months invested in
                                    completion make each Patek Philippe watch a precious, unique creation coveted by
                                    true connoisseurs.

                                    Each Patek Philippe watch embodies centuries of genuine experience and countless
                                    hours of work. Accordingly, it is a precious asset that will retain or even
                                    increase its value over the years. Many Patek Philippe models are genuine cult
                                    objects that fetch record prices at auction. They are deemed a solid investment
                                    amongst collectors with a high emotional value; most owners of a Patek Philippe
                                    watch consider it to be a precious and irreplaceable family heirloom.

                                    The aesthetic appeal of Patek Philippe watches is more than meets the eye. It is
                                    also an expression of their mechanical perfection. Their designs outlive passing
                                    fashion trends and always project contemporary beauty. Patek Philippe has
                                    established its own understated, timeless style: it is a harmonious combination
                                    of personality and discretion, elegance and uniqueness. The style has inspired
                                    true timepiece classics. It defines the creation and subtly evolving
                                    modification of watches that simply retain their irresistibility – yesterday,
                                    today, and tomorrow.

                                    To assure that its service addresses the loftiest expectations, Patek Philippe
                                    relies on a network of hand-picked dealers. The manufacture believes that it has
                                    a duty to provide the highest standard of after-sales service, and emphasizes
                                    this aspect as a key criterion of the Patek Philippe Seal. For each owner of a
                                    Patek Philippe watch, this ensures that after the sale, the timepiece will
                                    receive the care and attention needed to function reliably for generations.

                                    about passion, emotion, and affection. After all, a Patek Philippe is far more
                                    than an instrument that displays the time. It is a very personal and inimitable
                                    possession steeped in precious memories. The purchase of a Patek Philippe is
                                    often related to an important personal event – a professional success, a
                                    marriage or the birth of a child – and offering it as a gift is the most
                                    eloquent expression of love or endearment.

                                    scientific tradition that continues to inspire remarkable creations. It opens up

                            creativity of our people. Very human skills which cannot be rushed or replaced.

                            possible.
